# PointlessTestbedGame

An attempt to kick the tires of the Godot game engine

This probably won't be an actual game, though I suppose that one never knows.  Instead, [Godot](http://godotengine.org/) seems like it might be an interesting environment and something that may be useful for a real game, later.

On and off, I'll be borrowing pieces from various tutorials to see how it holds together.  Among them are [the official tutorials](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/_2d.html) and the relevant [Game From Scratch](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Godot-Game-Engine-tutorial-series.aspx) video series.
