# PointlessTestbedGame

An attempt to kick the tires of the Godot game engine

This probably won't be an actual game, though I suppose that one never knows.  Instead, [Godot](http://godotengine.org/) seems like it might be an interesting environment and something that may be useful for a real game, later.
